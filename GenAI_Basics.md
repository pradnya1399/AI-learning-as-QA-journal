# Generative AI Basics (QA Perspective)

## 1. What is Generative AI?
- Atificial intelliegence is a simulation of human intelligence in machine. 
it enables system to-> i) Make decision ii) understand natural language iii) learn from data iv) solve the problem
- Example: ChatGPT generating test cases from requirements.

**##2. What is Machine learning?**
Machine learning is a subset of AI where machines learn from data to make prediction or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
**Types of ML:**
1] Supervised learning-> Model learns from Labeled data. Types-> i) Classification-> predicts categories ii) Regression-> predicts numbers 
for example- Speech recognition converte spoken language to text
2] Unsupervised learning-> Model explored data without labels Types-> i) Clustering ii)Association
For example- Content recommendation classify and tag content to make it easier to recommend similar item to useres
3] Reinforcement learning-> Model  intercats and improve the performance based on feedback Algorithm-> i) QC learning ii)State action reward iii) Deep learning 
For example: Game playing-> RL can teach agents to play games even complex one


## 2. Key Terminologies
- **Prompting**: Giving input to AI for output (like writing a test case description).
- **Tokens**: Words/chunks AI processes. Example: “Bug report” = 2 tokens.
- **Bias**: AI leaning towards one pattern (e.g., always suggesting Chrome for testing).
-**Model**: A model is the brain trained on data. it receives input like(user queries) and produces output like (Prediction or response)
-**Training**: Feeding the model lots of data so it learns  patterns
-**Inference**: Using the trained data model to make real time prediction
-**Overfitting**: Models learns the training data too well, but fails on new data
-**Underfitting**: Model fails to learn meaningful patterns even on training data
-**Neural Networks**: Neural n/w is a type pf machine learning model designed to work like a simplified version of the human brain. it learns by observing examples and identifying patterns

## 3. Why QA should care?
- Can auto-generate:
  - Test scenarios
  - Test data
  - Defect reports
- Saves time and improves coverage.
